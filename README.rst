**Gerrit viewers & tools for all**
==================================

query_gerrit
------------

Use `query_gerrit` to find out what your friends have been up to::

    $ query_gerrit -u 'harlowja'


curse_gerrit
------------

Use `curse_gerrit` to in realtime watch the reviews showing up (powered by
urdwi_ and the curses_ library) and to see a similar format as gerrit by
in your terminal instead (did I mention realtime)::

    $ curse_gerrit
